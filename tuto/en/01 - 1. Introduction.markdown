##What is symfony all about?

Many of you may be familiar with [symfony](http://symfony-project.net/ "The symfony project"), currently one of the best OOP oriented PHP frameworks out there. It's a fast, scalable, immensely powerful and easily extensible framework that naturally guides the developer towards application of the agile development principles (such as [DRY](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontRepeatYourself), [KISS](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?KeepItSimpleStupid) or the [XP](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/ "") philosophy). Symfony is geared to build [enterprise applications](http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/category/Case+studies), giving full control over the code, configuration and folder structure to the developer.

However, with great power comes great responsibility, as was once said to a young Peter Parker. Symfony leaves all this power in the hands of the developer, but asks a lot in return.
>**Note about symfony**
> This tutorial assumes you are already familiar with symfony, and focuses on teaching you about Diem. If you have never used symfony before, head over to the [symfony-project](http://symfony-project.net) and check out their excellent [documentation](http://www.symfony-project.org/doc/1_4/).

## Enter Diem!

Diem builds on top of symfony to provide a user-friendly CMF (Content Management Framework) which will allow you to build common-case scenarios swiftly and without effort. While nothing is predefined in Diem (you start with an empty project just as you do with symfony), it comes bundled with a stellar set of [features](page:14 "Diem features") and offers download-able [plugins](http://diem-project.org/plugins) that will ease your life and make development faster.


## So what exactly does Diem offer over symfony?

Diem adds [a growing set of features](page:14 "Diem features") on top of symfony, useful for most projects, which developers would otherwise need to build themselves:

- Complete administration interface, with bundled logging and statistics features
- Markdown / CKEditor ready for use
- Efficient Search Engine Optimization through an intuitive JavaScript interface
- Automatic search engine powered by Zend Lucene
- Drag&drop based media library with gallery capabilities
- Developer tools: Project browser, code editors, and even an AJAX Unix console!
- [and much more...](page:14 "Diem features")


## What about performance?

It's the same as a well written symfony site - Diem uses intelligent view caching and utilizes APC if available. All Diem-generated code follows symfony's best practices in order to deliver the best performance your server is capable of.

On top of that you get automatic JavaScript / CSS minification and compression, enchanting the user experience with lower load times and saving you a buck in hosting taxes!


## I want to try it first!

Why, of course. We have prepared a demo version of Diem, running an instance of this very site. Feel free to head over and try it for yourself using the links and username/password below, or check out [this page](page:126 "Diem online demo") for more information:
